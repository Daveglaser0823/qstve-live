My AI noticed a health pattern I'd been ignoring for weeks.

I wear a Whoop band. It tracks recovery, sleep, strain, heart rate variability. Every morning I glance at the numbers and move on.

Steve doesn't just glance. He reads the data, compares it to last week, cross-references my calendar, and tells me what it actually means.

One morning he flagged that my HRV had been trending down for eight straight days. Recovery scores dropping. Sleep consistency falling apart. All while my calendar showed back-to-back travel weeks and late-night work sessions.

His summary was blunt: "You're accumulating a recovery debt. If you don't take a rest day soon, your body will choose one for you."

I took the rest day.

The data was always there. I just wasn't connecting the dots. That's what an AI with memory does. It sees the trendline, not just today's number.

We spend billions on health tracking hardware. Then we ignore the dashboard. An AI that reads the dashboard for you and says "hey, stop" might be the most valuable health tool of all.

What data are you collecting but not actually using?
