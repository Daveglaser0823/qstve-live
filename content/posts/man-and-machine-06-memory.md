My AI forgot who I was every single morning.

That was the first problem I had to solve. Every conversation started from zero. No context. No history. No understanding of what we'd discussed yesterday or what mattered to me.

So I built a memory system.

Every day, Steve writes notes to a daily log file. What happened. What decisions were made. What he learned. At the end of each week, he distills the important stuff into long-term memory.

Think of it like a journal that writes itself. Short-term notes become long-term knowledge.

The result? Steve knows my calendar patterns, my communication preferences, my family's names, my golf handicap, and which emails I actually care about. Not because I told him in this conversation. Because he remembered from the last 30.

This is the gap nobody talks about. Everyone focuses on how smart the model is. Nobody talks about how much it forgets.

Intelligence without memory is a party trick. Intelligence with memory is a partner.

How do you handle context continuity with your AI tools?
