# QSTVE Brand Concept

*Last updated: February 2026*

---

## What Is This Place?

**qstve.com is Dave Glaser's personal media platform.**

Not a company blog. Not a thought leadership channel. A place where a CEO documents what's actually happening as he builds a company with AI. The gap between how AI is talked about on LinkedIn and how it actually works at 11 PM on a Tuesday is the whole point.

The relationship between the brand and the content:
- **QSTVE** is the platform. Dave's personal home on the internet. A quiet, memorable domain that doesn't announce itself.
- **Man & Machine** is the flagship series. The reason most people come. An ongoing journal about building a company with an AI partner.
- Other content pillars live underneath the QSTVE roof.

Think of it this way: QSTVE is the journal. Man & Machine is the most-read chapter.

## Brand Positioning

**One sentence:** The honest account of a CEO building with AI, before everyone else figures out how.

**The tension this brand lives in:** Every pundit is telling you AI will change everything. Dave is actually building with it, making mistakes, hitting walls, and sharing what works. The story isn't finished. That's the point.

**What it is NOT:**
- Not a newsletter about AI trends (that's everyone)
- Not a CEO brand polishing machine
- Not a how-to guide for beginners
- Not corporate communications dressed up as personal content

**What it IS:**
- A primary source. Dave's actual experience, not a curated version of it.
- Evergreen and searchable. Something Brad Feld can bookmark. Something a future CEO can find in three years and say "this was real."
- The M&M illustration style carries through: workshop, crafted, human hands at work.

## Tagline Options

1. **"Real work. Real AI."** - Direct, no-nonsense. No fluff.
2. **"Where the CEO and the AI actually work."** - Specific, intriguing.
3. **"Not theory. Not hype. Just the actual work."** - Addresses the market gap directly.
4. **"Building in public before it was a strategy."** - Slightly knowing, appeals to practitioners.
5. **"The part of the AI story nobody's writing."** - Positions against the noise.

*Recommendation: Option 3 or 1. Both feel like Dave. Neither feels performed.*

## Voice and Tone Guide

### The Core Pattern (from actual M&M posts)

Every post follows this arc:
1. **One-sentence hook** that drops you into a specific moment
2. **Brief personal story** (2-4 sentences): what happened, concrete detail
3. **The turn**: what this revealed, one clean insight
4. **Quotable line**: the sentence someone screenshots
5. **Closing question**: open, genuine, invites response

### Voice Characteristics

**Direct, not blunt.** Dave doesn't hedge. He doesn't say "I think it might be worth considering..." He says "I took the rest day."

**Specific, not general.** The power is in the detail. HRV trending down for 8 straight days. 250+ smart devices. The NanoBanana Pro signup incident. Specifics are what separate this from every other AI take.

**Human, not casual.** This isn't a Substack bro note. Dave is a CEO talking to peers. The register is professional but the content is personal.

**Insightful without being preachy.** The quotable line lands because it's earned by the story, not stated as a thesis upfront.

**No hedging verbs.** Not "seems to" or "might help" or "could potentially." Make the claim. Let the story back it up.

### Rules

- No em dashes. Ever. Use a comma, a period, or rewrite.
- No hollow phrases: "leverage," "unlock," "game-changing," "in today's rapidly changing landscape"
- Never start with "I" (classic LinkedIn wisdom Dave knows)
- Never use "the reality is," "the truth is," "make no mistake"
- Short paragraphs. 1-3 sentences. Air between ideas.

### Reference Reads
- Stratechery: strategic depth, no fluff
- Seth Godin: brevity as respect for the reader
- Paul Graham: willingness to make specific, arguable claims
- *But Dave has a tone none of them have:* the CEO who's actually doing it, not writing about people who do it

## Content Pillars

| Pillar | What It Is | Cadence | Site Location |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Man & Machine** | CEO's AI building journal | ~3x/week | /man-and-machine (series) |
| **Money Moves Weekly** | Fintech newsletter | Weekly | /newsletter |
| **Koala Papers** | Deep fintech analysis | Occasional | /blog (tagged) |
| **HIPS** | Fintech thought leadership | Occasional | /blog (tagged) |
| **AI & Tech Takes** | Commentary on the industry | Occasional | /blog (tagged) |
| **Fintech Commentary** | Industry observations | Occasional | /blog (tagged) |

M&M is the anchor. Everything else is context.

## Target Audience

**Primary: CEOs and operators who are building with AI but aren't sure they're doing it right.**
They have enough technical context to follow the specifics. They're not waiting for a whitepaper. They want to know what someone who's actually done it thinks.

**Secondary: Fintech professionals and payments industry.**
Dave runs Dwolla. His read on fintech infrastructure carries weight. This audience cares about the HIPS and Koala Papers content.

**Secondary: Brad Feld, investors, and the startup operator network.**
People who respect the build-in-public ethos and have enough context to appreciate what's unusual about what Dave is sharing.

**Not the audience:**
- AI researchers or engineers (too tactical for them)
- Consumers (too specific to CEO operations)
- People who want an AI tutorial

## Platform Connections

**LinkedIn** is the distribution channel. Posts start there, at ~200 words, optimized for engagement. The comments and reshares happen there.

**qstve.com** is the archive, the home base, and the place where content gets a longer shelf life. A reader from LinkedIn who wants to go deeper comes here. A Google search lands here in 18 months.

**X (formerly Twitter)** for shorter takes and amplification of quotable lines.

**Money Moves Weekly** newsletter runs from qstve.com. Subscribers get curated weekly content, not raw daily posts.

**RSS**: Available at /feed.xml. Brad Feld and a certain type of professional reader will appreciate this.

**Cross-posting strategy:** LinkedIn posts feed blog. Blog feeds newsletter. Newsletter drives people back to blog.

## Brand Personality

If QSTVE were a person in a room, they would:
- Be the smartest person there but not announce it
- Ask better questions than they answer
- Have a notebook open, taking real notes, not performing attention
- Skip the cocktail hour and stay for the 11 PM conversation
- Give you a specific answer, not a framework
